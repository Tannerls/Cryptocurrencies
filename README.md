## Cryptocurrencies
### Analysis Overview
The purpose of this challenange was to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.
This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment to customers.

I use the following methods for the analysis:

preprocessing the database,
* reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
* clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
 * visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.

### Resources
Data Source: crypto_data.csv

### Results
Following the preprocessing and cleaning phase there are a total of 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.
